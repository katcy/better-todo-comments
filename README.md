Commentify provides the following features

- Allows users to configure custom comment templates that can be added as snippets inside their files.
- Provides a tree view of all the user's comment templates. Users can easily list the files containing comments they have added by clicking on the templates in the tree view.

## Features

- Users can configure multiple snippets with placeholders and choices for those placeholders. Refer to [Settings](#settings) for instructions on configuring these snippets.
- Snippets can be conveniently inserted into the editor window by using the keyboard shortcut <kbd>âŒ˜+K</kbd> <kbd>/</kbd> on macOS or <kbd>Ctrl+K</kbd> <kbd>/</kbd> on Windows/Linux. Users can customize this keyboard shortcut by changing the keybinding for the <kbd>commentify.insertSnippet</kbd> command.

## Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `commentify.snippets`: Array of snippet configurations.

Each object in the array corresponds to a snippet you want to configure. The object consists of the following properties:

| Property    | Type      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| name        | `string`  | User-friendly name to identify the snippet.                                                                                                                                                            |
| template    | `string`  | Comment template that gets inserted. May have placeholders inside `${}`.<br/>Placeholders can only contains <ul> <li>alpha-numeric characters</li><li>hyphen ( - )</li><li>underscore ( \_ )</li></ul> |
| choices     | `Object`  | Object that contains the array of choices for each placeholder.<br/> Any placeholders skipped will not be offered any choices.                                                                         |
| insertToTop | `boolean` | Inserts comment to the top of file instead of the line above. <br/> Default: `false`                                                                                                                   |
